# Buttons in Bootstrap 4

Welcome to Buttons in Bootstrap 4.  The purpose of this project is to investigate the buttons in Bootstrap 4.

## UX

A photo and information is included.  There is also a feedback form, which has reset and submit buttons.

As a user, I expect the image and the form to be responsive.

## Technologies

This project uses HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript.  Other technologies include Google Fonts and Font Awesome 5.8.1.

button clears the comments that are in the textarea.
